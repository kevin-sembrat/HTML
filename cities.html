        <p>I was born in Raleigh but my family and I relocated to New Jersey when
          I was about 10 years old. I lived there until I went to college in upstate
          New York, and moved to Columbus after graduating. I moved to Germany for my
          second duty station, and back to Georgia for my third. </p>
